This repository contains the code for the assignment, submitted for the job position as
"Research Assistant for Analyzing Financial Transaction Microdata" at the Department `Data Science Center`, 
Barcelona School of Economics.

The main code is contained in `notebooks/assignment.ipynb`.
In order to execute the code, we first suggest to create a new Python environment with 
```{bash}
conda create -n bbva python=3.11
```
Then you may want to uncomment the first cell of the notebook in order to run the BASH command
```{bash}
pip install -e ..
```
that will install this package called ```bbva_assignment``` into your new environment,
along with its dependencies.
